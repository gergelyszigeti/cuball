# cuball
WebGL version of my small 3D OpenGL and later CUDA morphing demo

It is available on the link [https://gergelyszigeti.github.io/cuball](https://gergelyszigeti.github.io/cuball/)

*The inspiration and much of the code came from this Shadertoy example:*

*I also learned from here how easy to work with SDF ray tracing in practice.*

*As I'm not a web expert and never used WebGL, I needed help and a lot of code also from here:*
